# How to start using script

Step 1. Head over to Discord and create a new webhook in a server and channel of your choice.

Step 2. Download the discordalerts.sh and discord.service. You can edit any lines in discordalerts.sh such as the Alert message, Location or host to your liking then save your changes.

Step 3. Use an FTP client to place discordalerts.sh into /root and place discord.service into /etc/systemd/system.

- Move discord.service to Systemd run mv /root/discord.service /etc/systemd/system/discord.service
- Create a dumps folder for pcaps run mkdir /root/dumps
